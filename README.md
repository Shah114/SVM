# SVM
Classification 
<br/>

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)** are a set of supervised learning methods used for **classification, regression, and outliers detection**. Developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues, SVMs are powerful tools capable of performing **linear and non-linear classification**. They are known for their **robustness in high-dimensional spaces** and **effectiveness** in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. <br/>
